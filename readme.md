# CotSA â€“ SDRâ€‘Based Automatic RF Component Analyzer

**CotSA** (Commercialâ€‘offâ€‘theâ€‘Shelf Analyzer) is an openâ€‘source MATLAB project that transforms a lowâ€‘cost Softwareâ€‘Defined Radio pairâ€”**HackRF One** for transmission and an **RTLâ€‘SDR (NESDR Smart V5)** for receptionâ€”into a flexible RF component analysis platform.

The toolbox automates common RF measurements such as:

- Powerâ€‘calibrated spectrograms and sweeps  
- Twoâ€‘tone intermodulation (IIP3) tests  
- Digital modulation analysis (e.g. 16â€‘QAM constellations & eye diagrams)  
- Gain, linearity and powerâ€‘transfer curve tracing  

A modular, objectâ€‘oriented architecture makes it easy to add new measurements or swap hardware.

## Quickâ€¯Start

1. **Clone** this repository.  
2. Install **MATLABÂ R2021aÂ (or newer)** with **Communications Toolbox**.  
3. Follow the steps in **DRIVERS** folder to add the SDR drivers and HackRF interface folder to your MATLAB path.  
4. Connect the **HackRF One** (TX) and **RTLâ€‘SDR** (RX) via USB.  
5. Run:

```matlab
run('CotSA/main.m');
```

## Trouble? 5â€‘Point ChecklistÂ ðŸ”§

If the program does not run correctly, verify that:

1. **Paths to external resources** in the code are valid (scripts, data, configs).  
2. Required **drivers and toolboxes** are installed.  
3. The **HackRF interface folder is on the MATLAB path**.  
4. **Devices are properly connected** and detected (`hackrf_info`, etc.).  
5. PortaPack (if present) is in **HackRF mode**, **not** standalone UI mode.

See **Software** folder for the full guide.
